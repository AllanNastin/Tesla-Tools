# These tools are designed to bring life to your MCU1 Tesla

## webhooks.html
This version allows you to create buttons to call webhooks directly from the MCU it will be stored in local storage for your next use. You can now delete these buttons.
This file is a simple HTML page that allows you to send webhooks from your Tesla MCU1. You can set the type of webhook you want to send on line 339.
