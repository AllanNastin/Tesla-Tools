# These tools are designed to bring life to your MCU1 Tesla

## webhooks.html
With this file, you can easily send webhooks from your MCCU1 Tesla. It provides a simple interface to save multiple webhooks and send them with a single click. The webhooks are stored in the browser's local storage, so after a restart, you don't have to retype them.

### Hosting
You can host this file on any web server. If you don't have a web server, you can use a free service like GitHub Pages or Netlify to host the file. Just upload the `webhooks.html` file to your repository and enable GitHub Pages or Netlify.

### Hosted Version
I am currently the latest `webhooks.html` at https://webhooks.sprinty.tech. You can use this URL to access the webhooks page without hosting it yourself.
